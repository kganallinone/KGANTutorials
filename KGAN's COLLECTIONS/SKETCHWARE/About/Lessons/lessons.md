Simply drag and drop widgets onto the standard mobile screen to edit their properties. After adding a function to the events based on the needs of your application, run it.

Why Sketchware is removed from Play Store? According to Sung Woo, one of Sketchware's creators. Sketchware is about to close down after two years of operation due to a lack of money to continue the service. The only way they can continue to provide the service is if users contribute financially.
