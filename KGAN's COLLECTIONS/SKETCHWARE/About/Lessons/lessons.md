## What is Sketchware Pro?

It is a modified version of the famous mobile app development tool *Sketchware* that contains new features and enhancements. The used of this free scratch based integrated development environment (IDE) is for developing real android applications using eXtensible Markup Language (XML) for front-end and Java for back-end . 

Even if you don't have experience or knowledge about developing android apps or java, you can do it quickly using Sketchware Pro. Simply drag and drop widgets onto the standard mobile screen to edit their properties. After adding a function to the events based on the needs of your application, run it.

Why Sketchware is removed from Play Store? According to Sung Woo, one of Sketchware's creators. Sketchware is about to close down after two years of operation due to a lack of money to continue the service. The only way they can continue to provide the service is if users contribute monetarily. 

Anyone interested in adding new features and functionality to the app is welcome to contribute to their github repository [[Click](https://github.com/Sketchware-Pro/Sketchware-Pro)].
